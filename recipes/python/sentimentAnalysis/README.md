# samples-python

_sentimentAnalysis_ is an intelligent service sample using python which can be onboarded on ML Framework.

# Steps:

```bash
$ git clone [[GITHUB BASE URL]]:ml/samples-python.git

$ sh ./build.sh
```

# NOTE: Currently versions are hardcoded in the script. There is room of automation in that process.

It follows the docker approach for ml-framework. Also, it doesnt use pipeline.json currently as all the configs are hardcoded to the app. In next iteration we plan to make use of pipeline.json.

# Current released version of samples-python:
[DOCKER ARTIFACTORY URL]/ml-sampleapp-python:0.3.0
